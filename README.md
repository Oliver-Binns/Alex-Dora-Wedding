# Alex-Dora-Wedding
##A simple, responsive one page website created for my brother's wedding.

The aim of the website is to give the guests information about the wedding. The site will be especially useful to the large number of guests who will be travelling from the UK to Greece for the wedding.

The source code for this wedding is freely available in both meanings of the word (free speech/free beer).
Feel free to use this code for your own purposes and edit where necessary, but please credit me where possible :)

There are dependencies on both Twitter Bootstrap and phpUI.
* (Twitter Bootstrap)[https://www.github.com/twbs/bootstrap]
* (phpUI)[https://www.github.com/Oliver-Binns/phpUI]

Both these dependencies should be copied into the root directory of the project.
```
